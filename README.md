#Project Description

The sharing economy, with popular applications such as Uber and AirBnB, is growing in terms of its impact on peoples’ everyday lives. Our project is to build a Web application along the lines of AirBnB specifically for Queen’s alumnae who wish to travel and to share their accommodations with other alumnae. The Queen’s Alumnae BnB service (QBnB) will facilitate matching alumnae intending to travel to a city with other alumnae offering accommodations to rent in that city. Alumnae must first become members of QBnB. Members with properties to rent, who we can refer to as suppliers, will register these accommodations with the service. Other members planning to travel, who we can refer to as consumers, will use QBnB to search for accommodations in their destination city. When a consumer finds an accommodation they are interested in they can check the availability of the accommodation for their desired dates and then submit a request to the supplier to rent the accommodation for a particular booking period. If the supplier agrees to the request they submit a confirmation to QBnB that changes the availability of the accommodation, otherwise they reject the booking.

#Part 1: Database Design and Implementation. 

TBC February 11, 2016.

- Design the ER schema for the database.
- Show all constraints and state any assumptions that we make which are not specified in the requirements.
- Convert the ER schema for the application to a relational schema. 
- Make sure you indicate the primary key and any foreign keys, as well as NOT NULL constraints, for each table.
- Create a database instance for your schema in MySQL and populate your database with some reasonable data.

#Part 2: User interface design and database interactions. 

TBC March 10, 2016.

- Describe the system from the point of view of its users.
- Use state machine diagrams to describe the navigational structure of the application and English text to describe the system's operation.
- Identify the interactions with the database in each state and give the SQL statements involved in the interaction.
- Test the SQL statements with a sample database and show the results of each statement.
- Include the relational schema from part 1 with any modifications you have made and show the contents of the sample database so results of your SQL statements can be verified.

#Part 3: Application demonstration and final report.

- Write PHP programs that implement the functional requirements outlined above.
- We may assume that user input is correct so input syntax checking can be minimal.
- Handle cases where queries return no results.
- As the minimum, your program can simply use prompted input and formatted output from the browser.

<h2>Final Report</h2>

TBC March 31, 2016.

Hand in the following:
- List of assumptions.
- The final versions of ER and relational schemas.
- The final version of state machine diagram.
- The final version of the SQL interactions in each state and sample output.
- A discussion including the following: problems encountered during the development and how we solved them; important design and implementation decisions; the technologies and tools we used in developing your application, why we chose them and what your experience was using them; things we would like to go back and change or do differently if we had the chance.
- A user’s guide to our application. This should be a document our could give to a new QBnB member or administrator to help them use our application.

<h2>Application Demonstration</h2>

TBC during the last week of classes.

- We will be required to demonstrate your application in the CASLAB (on CASLAB or your own machine).
- Both team members will be present and participate in the demo. A demo schedule in the last week of classes will be established later in the term.

For the demo we will:
- Create a sample database with enough data to adequately demonstrate all of the required functionality.
- Prepare a script to follow that allows us to show all of the features of your application in a logical sequence in a 10 minute demo.
- Have a hard copy of the ER schema available for reference during the demo.
- Be prepared to answer questions about the capabilities of our application and the development process you followed.
